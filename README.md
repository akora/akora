## 💡 Philosophy

I believe in **Simplicity First** - choosing the most practical solution over complex patterns. My repositories reflect this approach, focusing on:

- ✅ **Immediate usability** - tools that work out of the box
- ✅ **Clear documentation** - code that explains itself
- ✅ **Minimal dependencies** - lean and maintainable solutions
- ✅ **Real-world testing** - battle-tested in production environments
