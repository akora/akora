ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @akora, an IT enthusiast and developer who uses this space to work on a variety of personal projects. My focus is on hands-on exploration and creating practical solutions that leverage modern technologies.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in **web content management systems**, with a primary focus on modern platforms like **Drupal** and **Ghost**. I'm also passionate about **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **containerization** for building automated, scalable, and portable applications.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently expanding my skillset by diving deeper into **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and **Ansible** for configuration management. My goal is to use these tools to create fully automated, repeatable environments and workflows for my personal and professional projects.

ðŸ¤– I'm extensively integrating **AI coding assistants** into my workflow. These tools help me accelerate development by generating boilerplate code, refactoring existing scripts, and providing explanations for complex functions. This allows me to learn new technologies faster and focus on the architectural challenges of my projects.

ðŸ“« You can find more of my work and get in touch with me on my personal website: **https://www.andraskora.com**. Feel free to connect there to discuss my projects or any shared interests.
