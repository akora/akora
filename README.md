ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @akora, an IT enthusiast, in this space working on various personal projects.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web content management systems (mostly Drupal and Ghost), IaC, containerization, home lab building.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (re)learning Terraform and Ansible while extensively using AI assistants along the way.
